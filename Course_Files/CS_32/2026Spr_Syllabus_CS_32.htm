                Welcome to **Introduction to Computer Operating Systems**! Ever wonder how your laptop can stream music, download a file, and run a code editor all at the same time without crashing? Or how your phone keeps your private data safe while running dozens of apps? In this course we will go "under the hood" to explore the most complex piece of software ever created. An Operating System (OS) is the master coordinator—the bridge between the physical circuitry of your computer and the software you use every day.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This course is an introduction to the inner workings of operating systems. It covers how memory is allocated in main memory and secondary memory, how programs are executed as processes and threads, multitasking and multiprocessing, networking, distributed systems, system performance, and security. Students will study various examples of an operating system such as Microsoft Windows, Apple iOS or the Google Android operating system. (UC, CSU)

                    <p>Course attendance every week, whether the course is Online or In-Person, is IMPORTANT! **your presence is crucial!** Lectures, discussions, activities, labs, and assignments are designed to help you succeed. Think of it like leveling up in a game – you can't get experience points if you're not playing! Active participation will also count towards your grade. Course assignments, discussions, labs, activities, and tests are how your grade is determined. **It is your responsibility** to get all the work done! <span style="color: #ffff00;"><strong>Missing 2 or more graded activities may result in being dropped from the Course!</strong></span> If you have any questions, PLEASE ASK. I am here to facilitate your success. Check Canvas often, participate, read announcements, and do the work. <strong>You can do it!</strong> <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: #ffff00;">**During the first week of the course there will be 3 graded assignments due! ** CRUCIAL to avoid being DROPPED!</span></strong></p>

                    <p>Assignments have due dates for a reason – they help you stay on track and build knowledge sequentially. Assignments submitted late will have a penalty. Again, you are responsible for doing the work and doing it on time! Late penalty will be up to 10% of assignment score. (Depending on number of days late). <em>Pro Tip: Aim to finish early! You'll thank yourself later.</em></p>

                    <p>Make-up exams will only be granted for **verifiable, documented emergencies** (e.g., serious illness with a doctor's note, family emergency). You must contact me **as soon as possible**, preferably before the exam, to discuss arrangements. The same applies to extensions for major assignments under emergency circumstances.</p>

                    <p>This is a big one! All work submitted in this course must be **your own original work**, unless explicitly stated otherwise. **What's Okay:** Discussing concepts, getting help understanding errors. **What's NOT Okay:** Copying written work or code, sharing completed assignments, having someone else do your work. Any instance of academic dishonesty will result in a **zero for the assignment/exam**, and may be reported to the college. Let's keep it honest! Tools such as Turnitin may be used to check for similarities.</p>

                    <p>Our classroom, Online or In Person, is a learning community. Be respectful. Conduct should fit a classroom/learning environment. Be considerate of others. Do not argue, though questioning and presenting of ideas with supportive reasoning is encouraged. In the classroom, silence cell phones. Laptops for notes/exercises only. Ask questions! If you have questions about tutoring, check Delta Online Tutoring/NetTutor at this online link <a href="https://www.deltacollege.edu/academics/tutoring-and-academic-computing-lab/online-tutoring" target="_blank" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300">CLICK HERE! 💡</a></p>
                    <p>You may also consider working with a study group or post a question in the Cnavas course discussion board. Post general questions, comments, requests to form study groups, links to interesting articles or websites, or any course related information. Posts that are deemed inappropriate by the professor will be deleted and may result in student discipline. Other students are often quite helpful and will generally provide a lot of support. And, of course, you can always ask the Professor- in an online Canvas message!</p>

                    <p>Always Check Canvas for announcements. *Your professor may not have time to respond to all individual communications. If there are areas of general misunderstanding or errors, the problem may be addressed as an Announcement item or other mass communication method. Please understand that there are over 200 students enrolled in courses taught by your professor, which places a very heavy demand on your professor and as a result there may be little flexibility in handling of individual requests. Canvas email for private communications will be checked on a regular basis and is the best form of direct, private communication with your professor. *Office hours are best for detailed help!</p>
