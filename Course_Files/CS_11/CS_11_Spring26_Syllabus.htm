                    <p>Attendance every week is IMPORTANT, **your presence is crucial!** Lectures, discussions, and activities are designed to help you succeed. Think of it like leveling up in a game – you can't get experience points if you're not playing! Active participation will also count towards your grade. In addition to Attendance, online assignments, discussions, labs, and tests are how your grade is determined. **It is your responsibility** to get all the work done! If you have any questions, PLEASE ASK. I am here to facilitate your success. Check Canvas often, participate, read announcements, and do the assignments. You can do it! <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; **During the first week of the course there will be 3 check-in assignments due! ** CRUCIAL to avoid being DROPPED!</strong></p>

                    <p>Assignments have due dates for a reason – they help you stay on track and build knowledge sequentially. Assignments submitted late will have a penalty. Again, you are responsible for doing the work and doing it on time! Late penalty will be 1% of assignment score per day. (Example: 3 days late = 3% penalty, deduction from assignment score). <em>Pro Tip: Aim to finish early! You'll thank yourself later.</em></p>

                    <p>Make-up exams will only be granted for **verifiable, documented emergencies** (e.g., serious illness with a doctor's note, family emergency). You must contact me **as soon as possible**, preferably before the exam, to discuss arrangements. The same applies to extensions for major assignments under emergency circumstances.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-yellow-300 mb-1"><span class="policy-icon">🛡️</span>Academic Integrity: Code with Honor!</h3>
                    <p>This is a big one! All work submitted in this course must be **your own original work**, unless explicitly stated otherwise. **What's Okay:** Discussing concepts, getting help understanding errors. **What's NOT Okay:** Copying written work or code, sharing completed assignments, having someone else do your work. Any instance of academic dishonesty will result in a **zero for the assignment/exam**, and may be reported to the college. Let's keep it honest! Tools such as Turnitin may be used to check for similarities.</p>

                     <p>Our classroom, Online or In Person, is a learning community. Be respectful. Conduct should fit a classroom/learning environment. Be considerate of others. Do not argue, though questioning and presenting of ideas with supportive reasoning is encouraged. In the classroom, silence cell phones. Laptops for notes/exercises only. Ask questions! If you have questions about tutoring, check Delta Online Tutoring/NetTutor at this online link <a href="https://www.deltacollege.edu/academics/tutoring-and-academic-computing-lab/online-tutoring" target="_blank" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CLICK HERE!</span></strong> 💡</a></p>
                    <p>You may also consider working with a study group or post a question in the Canvas course discussion board. Post general questions, comments, requests to form study groups, links to interesting articles or websites, or any course related information. Posts that are deemed inappropriate by the professor will be deleted and may result in student discipline. Other students are often quite helpful and will generally provide a lot of support. And, of course, you can always ask the Professor- in an online Canvas message!</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-yellow-300 mb-1"><span class="policy-icon">📬</span>Communication: Stay Connected!</h3>
                    <p>Always Check Canvas for announcements. *Your professor may not have time to respond to all individual communications. If there are areas of general misunderstanding or errors, the problem may be addressed as an Announcement item or other mass communication method. Please understand that there are over 200 students enrolled in courses taught by your professor, which places a very heavy demand on your professor and as a result there may be little flexibility in handling of individual requests. Canvas email for private communications will be checked on a regular basis and is the best form of direct, private communication with your professor. *Office hours are best for detailed help!</p>
